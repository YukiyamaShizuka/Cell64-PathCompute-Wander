# Cell64: Post-Permission Microarchitecture for Path-Based Execution  
*Yukiyama Shizuka, May 2025*

## 1. Introduction

Modern processors are designed around the assumption that tasks are untrusted, memory is contested, and execution must be arbitrated via privilege layers. These assumptions lead to complex trap logic, shared cache coherency protocols, and speculative scheduling units—all of which consume silicon, energy, and time.

**Cell64** proposes a radically simplified transistor-level microarchitecture designed for a different reality: one defined by **TreeOS**, where execution follows deterministic paths, and privilege arbitration becomes irrelevant.

By eliminating permission-checking circuits and restructuring execution around **Sap message flows**, Cell64 enables predictable, secure, and efficient execution at the physical substrate level.

## 2. System Philosophy

Cell64 is not a general-purpose processor. It is a **substrate tailored for deterministic OS models**, such as TreeOS, that:

- Predefine memory regions per task path
- Eliminate dynamic thread creation
- Separate compute logic from scheduling and arbitration

This allows Cell64 to **remove entire categories of logic gates** found in conventional CPUs, and replace them with dedicated **path-bound execution clusters**.

## 3. Architectural Overview

### 3.1 No Privilege Rings

- No supervisor mode, no trap gates, no syscall transitions
- All execution units operate in **static binding context**, as defined by SapClarify streams
- Hardware does not check permissions—it verifies **path identity and memory scope**

### 3.2 Microcore Cluster Model

Instead of wide, speculative superscalar cores, Cell64 features **specialized microcore clusters**, called **corelets**, each with a fixed execution duty:

- **Math Corelets**: ALU / FPU instructions
- **Memory Corelets**: DMA / VRAM / shared path transfer
- **Logic Corelets**: condition checks, Sap control
- **Composition Corelets**: final result synthesis per execution path

Each corelet is isolated in its own physical space, with **no shared register bank or L1/L2 cache conflict**.

### 3.3 Sap Message Flow Execution

Instructions arrive not via traditional PC + fetch, but as **Sap messages**, each containing:

- Execution type (math, memory, control)
- Data location and memory scope
- Validity time window
- Path identity token (no privileges, just routing)

These messages are routed to the correct cluster and processed deterministically.

## 4. Memory and Data Flow Model

### 4.1 Cacheless Execution

Cell64 does not rely on shared L1/L2 cache. Instead, each path allocates memory during compile time, and each cluster accesses memory **exclusively**. No coherency protocol is required.

### 4.2 Physical Memory Isolation

Path-allocated memory blocks are physically separated, either in:
- Independent DRAM slices
- Optical-connected VRAM units
- SRAM window zones

Since only one corelet touches any memory region per path cycle, race conditions are physically eliminated.

## 5. Compiler Integration with TreeOS

TreeOS assigns SapClarify execution graphs to Cell64 clusters as follows:

- Each path is translated into a message graph
- Each node in the graph targets a cluster and memory block
- Timing is pre-resolved, and all resource contention eliminated at compile time

This means:
- **No runtime scheduler**
- **No context switches**
- **No instruction-level traps**

## 6. Advantages Over Traditional Architectures

| Feature                     | Traditional CPU           | Cell64                         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Privilege Enforcement       | Rings + traps             | Path binding only              |
| Thread Scheduling           | OS-level, dynamic         | Precompiled execution graph    |
| Memory Access               | Shared + coherent caches  | Pre-bounded exclusive regions  |
| Instruction Fetch           | PC + speculative fetch    | Sap message routing            |
| Performance Predictability  | Low                       | Clock-cycle deterministic      |
| Side-channel Surface        | High                      | Physically minimal             |

## 7. Physical Implications

- Estimated 20–30% reduction in silicon area per core cluster
- Power consumption drop due to removal of trap, switch, coherence logic
- Clock sync is global and statically timed; phase jitter is negligible
- Potential for full-die optical interconnects with microcluster pairing

---

## 8. Experimental Direction

Cell64 is currently a conceptual design. Future development goals include:

- Signal-to-celllet assembler with Sap path compiler
- FPGA implementation of isolated microcore routing
- Optical VRAM prototype integration
- TreeOS instruction replay trace debugger
