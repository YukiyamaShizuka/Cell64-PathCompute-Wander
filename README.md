# Cell64: Post-Permission Microarchitecture for Path-Based Execution

**Cell64** is a speculative processor architecture designed to run TreeOS natively — not by compatibility, but by philosophical alignment. It eliminates permission-based logic from hardware design and replaces traditional cores with tightly-scoped functional microcore clusters, bound together via message-driven execution graphs.

Where modern CPUs arbitrate, **Cell64 routes**.

## Why Cell64?

TreeOS defines execution not as time-sliced tasks, but as deterministic, pre-defined **paths**. Under such a model:

- There are no threads.
- There are no shared mutexes.
- There is no privilege ring.

So why should the hardware still pay the price for features that are no longer needed?

## Architectural Principles

### 1. No Privilege Arbitration Circuits

- Traditional CPUs dedicate a significant portion of transistor logic to trap handling, context switching, and privilege enforcement.
- **Cell64 removes them entirely**, reducing logic area and heat output, while increasing instruction determinism.

### 2. Clustered Functional Microcores

- Instead of wide superscalar cores, Cell64 deploys **“corelets”** — ultra-thin execution clusters, each specialized:
  - ALU clusters (integer/floating point math)
  - VRAM/DMA clusters (memory-bound I/O)
  - Branch + prediction corelets (for local path fork/rejoin)
- Each cluster receives only **the instructions assigned to its path domain**.

### 3. Sap Message Flow Bus

- Control flow is passed via **Sap-bound messages** (as defined in the TreeOS SapClarify protocol).
- Each message carries:
  - **Execution intent**
  - **Target data scope**
  - **Memory access ticket**
  - **Route identity** for verification (not privilege)

### 4. Deterministic Memory Binding

- No cache coherence protocol is needed.
- Paths pre-bind memory blocks at runtime.
- Clusters work on **exclusive local memory**, with no speculative invalidation.

## Execution Model Summary

| Traditional CPU          | Cell64                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Syscalls, traps, privilege rings | Sap messages, path-bound verification |
| Instruction fetch + speculation | Precompiled message graph |
| Global L1/L2 cache arbitration | Per-path memory reservation |
| Superscalar wide-core     | Corelet clusters with fixed duty |
| Runtime locks             | Compile-time memory exclusivity |

---

## Benefits

- **Energy-efficient execution**: no speculative invalidation, no ring transitions
- **Predictable performance**: 100% path-deterministic timing, ideal for hard real-time
- **Security-hardened**: absence of side-channel surfaces (no privilege switches, no shared branches)
- **Compiler-friendly**: TreeOS/SapClarify compiler pre-splits workloads by memory and core type

## Intended Integration

Cell64 is designed to be fabricated as an **ASIC**, or partially emulated in FPGA for research purposes.  
It is not meant to run existing operating systems. It exists **only to run TreeOS**, or other execution-layer systems that adopt the **path-bound, no-kernel, no-privilege model**.

## Project Status

This repository currently includes architectural overviews and speculative whitepapers.  
Prototyping under Signal-compiled microcode is in early drafting.
